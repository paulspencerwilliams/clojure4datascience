# My code to support reading Clojure for Data Science

As a long time Clojure dabbler, I've wanted to explore it's relationship with 
mathematics and data science. [Clojure for Data Science]
(https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/clojure-data-science) 
 has been recommended several times as not only does it dig 
into the maths, but also big data concerns like stream processing. I've chosen 
to write the code out of the book as it allows me to understand the concepts 
better than just running the examples provided.
